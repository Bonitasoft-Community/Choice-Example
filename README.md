Choice-Example
==============

This is a short process to demonstrate how to select the next task in Bonita BPM, depending of choices in a form

The initiator form (on the pool) has a simple select field, where you choose the next step you want to go. Then, the transitions after the OR gate test the choice, so the next step is the selected task.

In the 3 steps, the forms shows the value selected, that confirm what you did. 

A simple and easy to use example. If you need a more complex example, you can have a look at "Bonita Escape", in the same GitHub.
